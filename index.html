        You should notice faint, dark spots in the intersections of the grid
        lines in the periphery of your vision. If try to look at any one
        directly, it vanishes.

        The most common explanation for this is lateral inhibition. The primary
        drivers of this are retinal ganglion cells.

        Retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) are a type of neuron in the eye that
        receive information from photoreceptors via two intermediary neuron
        types, bipolar cells and amacrine cells.
      </p>

      <p>
        One RGC receives input from multiple photoreceptors, and this makes up
        the RGC's receptive field. When photoreceptors in the center of this
        receptive field detect an increase in luminance, aka more light, they
        send excitatory signals to the RGC to get it to fire its own signal
        towards the brain, letting it know that there is something there.
        However, the photoreceptors on the outside of this photoreceptor cluster
        send inhibitory signals to the RGC when they detect more light, trying
        to get it to not fire.
      </p>

      <p>
        Because of this, the intersections have more areas of intense luminosity
        around them compared to points in the middle of a grid line. The
        increased peripheral luminosity at the intersections trigger more of the
        photoreceptors at the edges of a receptive field, causing it to be less
        activated, and thus the area of vision it controls appears darker.
